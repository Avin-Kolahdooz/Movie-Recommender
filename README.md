# Movie-Recommender
This is a content-based movie recommender system using NLP approaches
This project is an implementation of a movie recommender system using natural language processing (NLP) approaches. The system recommends movies to users based on their input text.
To use this movie recommender system, you need to provide a brief description of a movie that you like. The system will recommend movies that are similar to your input based on their descriptions.

This system uses the CountVectorizer and cosine similarity to process and compare the movie descriptions. The CountVectorizer technique is used to convert the movie descriptions into a matrix of token counts. The cosine similarity technique is used to calculate the similarity between the input movie description and the descriptions of all the movies in the dataset.

The dataset used in this project is the TMDB Movies Dataset, which contains information about movies. The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle.
